## Datasets Overview

> I collected and manually annotated these images into creating this dataset.

### Overhead Detection Dataset
- **Dataset Name**: Overhead Detection
- **Number of Images**: 6607
- **Source**: [Overhead Detection on Roboflow](https://universe.roboflow.com/abhayfinal/overhead-detection/model/1)
- **Characteristics**:
  - Extensive collection of images for detecting individuals from an overhead perspective.
  - Utilized in conjunction with YOLOv8 for efficient and accurate detection.
  - Suitable for applications requiring top-view analysis of crowd dynamics or individual movements.

### Angle Orientation Detection Dataset
- **Dataset Name**: Angle Orientation Detection
- **Number of Images**: 5000
- **Source**: [Angle Orientation Detection on Roboflow](https://universe.roboflow.com/abhay-chebium-qtdch/overhead-angle-detection-6lmpn/model/3)
- **Characteristics**:
  - Focuses on detecting the orientation of individuals from overhead images.
  - Includes a diverse range of angles, with a special emphasis on normal situations, level, and 45-degree angles.
  - Paired with YOLOv8 and Roboflow for advanced angle classification.
  - Ideal for scenarios where understanding the direction or orientation of individuals in a crowd is crucial.

### Tools for Classification
- **YOLOv8**: Leveraged for its high-speed and accurate object detection capabilities.
- **Roboflow**: Provides robust tools for training and deploying machine learning models, enhancing the performance of YOLOv8 in these specific applications.

### Applications
- The combination of these datasets and tools is particularly valuable in scenarios like crowd monitoring, behavior analysis, and spatial dynamics studies.
