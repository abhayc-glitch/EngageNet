### EngageNet Code

- `calculation`: Contains modules that handle the mathematical computations of engagement metrics using Euclidean distances.
- `data-process`: Includes scripts for preprocessing and formatting the data collected during conferences for analysis.
- `models`: Stores the machine learning models that predict engagement levels, trained using Euclidean metrics.
- `preprocess`: Contains utilities for initial data cleaning and preparation before feeding into the engagement tracking models.
- `setup`: Holds configuration files and scripts for setting up the software environment and dependencies for the tracker.
- `test`: Includes test cases and scripts to ensure the reliability and accuracy of the engagement tracking algorithms.
- `variants`: Contains alternative approaches or experimental versions of the engagement tracking algorithms for comparison.
- `cli.py`: The command-line interface for interacting with the tracker, allowing users to start tracking, and view reports.
- `main.py`: The main executable script that integrates all components of the tracker and starts the engagement analysis process.
